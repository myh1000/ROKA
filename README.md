Reddit on KissAnime (RoKA)
=========

A Chrome extension that embeds Reddit comments, on KissAnime and KissManga!

Original source code and inspiration from [alientube](https://github.com/xlexi/alientube/).

# Installation
Installation of RoKA requires Sass and TypeScript (Maybe not in the future).
### OS X/Linux:
Run ```chmod +x make.sh``` in the shell  to give the file executable rights.

Run `./make.sh_` to copy compile resources and copy them to the individual browser extensions.

Add the `--debug` parameter to compile in debug mode with source maps.
